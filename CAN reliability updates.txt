I got the black-out detection and reconfiguration working.  (In speed mode, the Jaguar is up and running with all relevant settings restored in about 200ms )
However, I'm having more trouble detecting situations when the controller is simply disabled (brown-outs, watchdog timeouts, etc.)
What I tried to do was:
If robot is enabled
AND the output setpoint sent is greater than 2^-8
AND the output setpoint (when retreived) is 0
THEN the robot is disabled and needs to be re-enabled.

As you might guess, being disabled does reset the output setpoint of a Jaguar back to 0.  (The Jaguar does not remember its last nonzero output when it is re-enabled)

Anyways, I was having some trouble with that, I'm not quite sure what the issue is.  Unfortunately, the Jaguars do have a message which tells you whether they are enabled or disabled (though they can tell you what mode of operation).

I have not gone back and tested the robot with the wireless radio, but I may get to that on Monday.
I will be busy over the weekend, and most likely will not make any progress on this for that time.  However, please post your thoughts and experiences.

What issues do you want the Jaguars to automatically recover from?
Black-out?  (completely reconfigure device)
Brown-out?  (re-enable device and re-send output setpoint)
Temporary watchdog timeout?  (re-enable device and re-send output setpoint)
CAN cable faulty?   (re-enable device and re-send output setpoint)
Others?

Should there be diagnostic messages?  Should the robot try to determine what the issue was?  (distinguish between brown-out, watchdog, and CAN bus problem?)
Should a robot have a system check on startup to make sure everything is working?
