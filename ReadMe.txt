I'm still in the process of updating all of these functions from the public CAN release to the Beta release.
However, I am doing new development and testing.

Pay attention to the "date last modified".  I didn't put this in Git until December 24th of 2010, though I have been working on it since June of 2010.  Some things I haven't touched since summer, and may not work without thorough updating.

Also, this a personal repository.  Most VIs aren't commented as well as they should be if they were a professional product.

Everything in this repository is in the public domain.  If you like it, tell people where you found it.  I'm not going to assert rights over how you use this software.  I'm giving it to you.  It's free.
